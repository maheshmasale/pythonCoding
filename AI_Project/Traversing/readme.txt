I am reading directly from roads.pl file and printing the result for 3 questions.
There is only one change in roads.pl file viz. each individual road and city data is on new line. 
In given file some of the lines had data for two roads. Check attached roads.pl file for more details.

For running my code execute below command.
python aStar_BFS_DFS_Python3.py

I have attached code files for both the python versions.
